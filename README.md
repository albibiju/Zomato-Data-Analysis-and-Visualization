# Zomato Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize Zomato restaurant data to derive meaningful insights that can help understand key business trends. The dataset includes restaurant information such as location (city, country), cuisine types, ratings, cost, delivery options, opening dates, and other relevant details. By analyzing this data, the project aims to uncover patterns in restaurant distribution, pricing, customer preferences, and service offerings across different cities and countries. It also aims to explore how factors like restaurant ratings and delivery options correlate with business performance. The insights gained from this analysis are visualized through interactive dashboards, making it easier to interpret complex data and draw actionable conclusions.

I developed this project individually using Tableau, Excel, and Power BI. Excel was used for data cleaning and transformation, Power BI helped in building the data model and calculating KPIs, while Tableau was used for creating dynamic and visually engaging dashboards. This project highlights my ability to use data analysis and visualization tools to extract insights and communicate findings effectively.


## Key Insights 

- **Calendar Table:** Generate time-based metrics (Year, Month, Quarter, etc.) using formulas.

- **Currency Conversion:** Convert local currency to USD using exchange rates.

- **Restaurant Analysis:** Group and count restaurants based on location, rating, and time.

- **Percentage Analysis:** Calculate percentages for various attributes (Table Booking, Online Delivery).

- **Charts and Visualization:** Develop charts to visualize the distribution of restaurants based on various KPIs like cuisine, ratings, and location.

## Conclusion

This project successfully uncovered valuable insights about restaurant trends, pricing, customer preferences, and service offerings. By utilizing Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, I demonstrated my ability to analyze complex data, generate key metrics, and create interactive dashboards to present actionable insights effectively.
